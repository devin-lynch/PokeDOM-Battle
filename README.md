#### For my project I will be making a Pokemon battle!

### TECHSTACK:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript

### MVP GOALS:
    * Have outcome of battle result in either the player's/computer's Pokemon 'fainting' (health points reaching zero)
    * Create a few different attacks to pick from with different amounts of damage being dealt
    * Randomize cpu attacks
    * Victory/defeat message
    * Track health points on screen
    
---

### STRETCH GOALS:
    * A 'wiggle' animation on the attacking pokemon upon attacking
    * Status effects
    * Being able to use a potion to restore health
    * Potential for 'critical attacks'
    * Potential for 'missed attacks'

 ---

### ROADBLOCKS:
    * Adding music/sounds to the game
    * Typewriter effect on text
    * Nesting game into a gameboy screen
