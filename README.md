## PokeDOM Battle!
---
#### For my project I will be making a Pokemon battle!
---
### TECHSTACK:
    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript

---

### MVP GOALS:
    Have outcome of battle result in either the player's/computer's Pokemon 'fainting' (health points reaching zero)
    Create a few different attacks to pick from with different amounts of damage being dealt
    Victory/defeat message
    
---

### STRETCH GOALS:
    A 'wiggle' animation on the attacking pokemon upon attacking
    Status effects
    Being able to use a potion to restore health
    Potential for 'critical attacks'
    Potential for 'missed attacks'

 ---

### ROADBLOCKS:
    Adding music/sounds to the game (not something we've reviewed yet/unsure if this is doable in JS)

---

#### WIREFRAME:
